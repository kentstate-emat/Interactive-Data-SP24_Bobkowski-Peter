    "The questions this project aimed to address are:\n",
    "1. Where in the United States are high schools with student journalism programs located? and\n",
    "2. What are the differences between high schools with and without student journalism programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are fundamental to my work as Knight Chair in Scholastic Journalism. My position was created to support high school journalism programs across the United States. To fulfill this mission effectively, I must first understand and be able to convey to fellow advocates where student journalism programs are located and what differentiates schools that offer journalism experiences versus those that do not. I and others can then use this baseline knowledge to tailor journalism education initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that a future iteration of this work will live on the [Center for Scholastic Journalism](https://www.kent.edu/mdj/csj) website and serve as a useful tool for understanding the scope of student journalism in the United States, and the discrepancies that exist in this space."

In many cases the SNO school names did not match exactly the school names in the NCES dataset (e.g., West High School (in Anchorage) vs. Anchorage West High). The `pandas.merge` method only matched 27% of the SNO schools that were labeled identically to how they were labeled in the NCES schools. \n",

The others did not match the NCES dataset because they were private or middle schools, or were not schools. \n",

Three maps show rural, urban, and suburban schools, and among these identify the schools with SNO websites.

Student race/ethnicity is provided in the NCES dataset for each school. Poverty/affluence is based on the number of students in each school who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.
